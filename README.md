## Short description
Inspired by Space Invaders, this game features a ninja fighting incoming food enemies by throwing bottles of hot sauce. 

The player wins a level if they manage to shoot down all incoming foods before these reach the bottom of the screen. Foods progress down in a zig zag block motion, shooting forks randomly throughout their movement. 

If the ninja is hit by a fork, the player loses a life. The game is lost if the player loses all lives, or if a food item reaches the last row.

## Technologies used
The game is using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and was deployed with GitHub Pages.
